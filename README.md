# PHPMachinist: Testing Object Factory

## What???!??!
A Slightly less annoying way of creating database fixtures for PHP testing. It borrows heavily from
several projects:

* https://github.com/chriskite/phactory
* https://github.com/thoughtbot/factory_girl
* https://github.com/ccollins/milkman
* https://github.com/notahat/machinist

They're totally awesome. Just either in the wrong language, or didn't quite do what I wanted.

## Install
http://pearhub.org/projects/machinist

## Examply thing
some tables:

	create table `stuff` ( 
		`id` INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT, 
		`name` varchar(100), 
		`box_id` INTEGER NULL DEFAULT NULL
    );
    create table `box` (
        `id` INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
        `type` varchar(100)
    );


	use machinist\Machinist;
	use machinist\driver\SqlStore;
	// setup a default connection to use
	Machinist::Store(SqlStore::fromPdo(new \PDO('sqlite::memory:'));
	// make a blueprint for cardboardb oxes.. in the box table.. with a type..
	$boxBlueprint = Machinist::Blueprint("cardboardbox", "box", array("type" => "cardboard"));

	Machinist::Blueprint("crayon",
	    array(
	        "name" => "crayon",
	        "box" => Machinist::Relationship($boxBlueprint)->local("box_id"),
	    ),
	    "stuff");

	$crayon = Machinist::Blueprint("crayon")->make();
    $redCrayon = Machinist::Blueprint("crayon")->make(array("name" => "red crayon"));

## Testing
Testing of the source code can be done with the PHPUnit version 3.6 or better.

To begin testing you must first add the dependencies by executing the "vendors" file.  This will place the all of the dependencies in the vendor directory.

A default phpunit.xml is configured in the test directory.
